    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>3 large whole russet potatoes</ul>
        <ul>2 TBSP high-heat-resistant vegetable oil</ul>
        <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>
        <ul>3 TBSP butter</ul>
        <ul>4 sprigs thyme, plus more for garnish</ul>
        <ul>1/2 cup chicken broth, or more as needed</ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)</ol>
    <ol>Step 2: Cut off ends of russet potatoes. Stand potatoes on end, and peel them from top to bottom with a sharp knife to make each potato into a uniform cylinder. Cut each cylinder in half crosswise to make 6 potato cylinders about 2 inches long.</ol>
    <ol>Step 3: Place potatoes into a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes to remove starch from the outisdes; pat dry with paper towels</ol>
    <ol>Step 4: Heat vegetable oil in a heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat until it shimmers slightly.</ol>
    <ol>Step 5: Place potato cylinders with the best-looking ends into the hot oil. Reduce heat to medium-high, and pan-fry potatoes until well-browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.</ol>
    <ol>Step 6: Flip potatoes and repeat on the other ends. As they cook, use a paper towel held with tongs to carefully blot out the oil from the skillet. Add butter and thyme sprigs to the skillet.

    </ol>
    <ol>Step 7: Pick up a thyme sprig with tongs and use it to paint butter over the top of the potatoes. Cook until butter foams and foam turns from white to a pale tan color. Season with more salt and pepper. Pour chicken stock into skillet.</ol>
    <ol>Step 8: Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook until potatoes are tender and creamy inside, about 30 minutes. If potatoes aren't tender, add 1/4 cup more stock and cook for 10 more minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Step 9: Place potatoes on a serving platter. Spoon thyme-scented butter remaining in skillet over potatoes. Garnish with thyme sprigs. Let cool about 5 minutes before serving.</ol>
